	elements and restructure your document. On platforms
	which support Drag &amp; Drop, you can drag an element
	from the tree and drop it into a place where the element
	is valid according to the DTD. You can drop it within
	the same document or on another document of the same
	type. Lines and rectangles are drawn on the tree as
	you're dragging over it to show where the element
	would be dropped if you release the mouse. You can also
	drag items into the library as dicussed in 
	<a href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Using the Library">Chapter 4</a> If the drop location does not
	allow the item being dragged to be inserted at that
	point, an error message will appear for a few seconds in
	the status bar at the bottom of the document window.
      </p><p>The second and probably more
	reliable method for moving elements is to use Copy or
	Cut, and Paste. Use the copy and paste menu items
	available when you right-click on an element. These
	actions don't work from the menus for elements in
	the tree view with Xerlin 1.2. You can paste items into,
	after, or before another node. This works the same as
	the Add, Add-&gt;Before, and Add-&gt;After actions. Only
	valid pastes according to the DTD will be allowed as
	shown in <a href="ch03s04.html#fig-paste-node" title="Figure 3.8. Pasting Nodes">Figure 3.8</a> </p><div class="figure"><p><a name="fig-paste-node"></a><b>Figure 3.8. Pasting Nodes</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/fig-paste-node.gif"></div></div><p>To remove
	elements, simply right-click on what you want to
	removed, and choose <font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><b>Delete</b></font>.
	This removes the highlighted element and its
	sub-elements. If you accidentally delete something you
	didn't want to, Xerlin supports up to 10 levels of
	Undo. Undo also works for Cut, Paste, and Adding of
	elements.  </p></div></body></html>
