	other elements you want to reuse, you can use the items
	by copy &amp; paste, or drag &amp; drop. The same
	DTD-based rules apply to elements coming from the
	library as to elements from other documents. If there is
	more than one element in a library item, then only the
	first element is checked for validity with the
	destination. Also, Xerlin 1.2 does not enforce that the
	document an element came from and the document it's
	being pasted into have the same DTD or doctype.</p><p>The Library is automatically saved when you quit,
	or when you close the library window. If you
	specifically want to make sure your changes to the
	library are saved, you need to close the library
	window.</p></div></body></html>
