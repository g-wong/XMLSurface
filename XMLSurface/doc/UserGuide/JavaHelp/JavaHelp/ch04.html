Using the Library</h2></div></div><p>Xerlin has a feature which allows you
      to reuse elements between documents, or create templates of
      structures you use often. This is called the Library. You
      can drag any item from the Element Tree of a document into
      the library creating a new reusable element.  </p><div class="section"><a name="N1BE"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="N1BE"></a>Creating a New Library</h2></div></div><p>To use a
	Library, you first need to create a new one, or open an
	existing one. To create a new one, simply choose the
	<font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><b>New Library</b></font> item on the
	<font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><b>File</b></font> menu. Xerlin will ask for a name
	for the library. This is just a symbolic name you can
	use to keep track of different libraries. This name is
	used at the title of the library window. Next you will
	be given a Save File dialog. Choose a filename and
	location for the library file. Libraries are saved
	automatically when you close it, or when you quit
	Xerlin, so the file location must be determined before
	creating the library.</p><p>When you first
	have a new library, the window is empty. You must add
	sections to it before you can add any elements to the
	library. These sections provide a way to organize many
	items into categories. To add a new section, right-click
	in the library window, and choose <font size="2" face="arial,helvetica"><b>New
	  Section</b></font> as shown in <a href="ch04.html#fig-library-new-section" title="Figure 4.1. New Section in a Library">Figure 4.1</a>
      </p><div class="figure"><p><a name="fig-library-new-section"></a><b>Figure 4.1. New Section in a Library</b></p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/fig-library-new-section.gif"></div></div><p>After you have a
	section, you can add items by drag &amp; drop as
	discussed in <a href="ch03s04.html" title="Moving and Removing Elements">the section called &ldquo;Moving and Removing Elements&rdquo;</a> or
	copy and paste into the section you want to put
	something in.   </p></div></div></body></html>
