Introduction</h2></div></div><p>Xerlin (pronounced zer-lin)
      is an application for creating XML files. It runs on Java 2
      virtual machines (JDK1.2.2 or JDK1.3). Xerlin simplifies how
      you interact with an XML file by hiding the raw text form of
      XML. It gives a user interface for adding, removing, and
      rearranging XML elements. It also gives a nice interface for
      editing the attributes of elements. Xerlin has been
      developed for end users who may not be familiar with XML,
      but it also provides a useful interface for people who know
      XML really well.</p><p>An example of what the
      Xerlin interface looks like is given in <a href="ch01.html#fig-intro-merlot-interface" title="Figure 1.1. Xerlin Interface">Figure 1.1</a>

	of XML is beyond the scope of this document, however we
	will cover some of the basic XML concepts you will need
	to know in order to use Xerlin prodcutively.
	XML stands for eXtensible Markup
	Language. It is similar to HTML,
	HyperText Markup Language, except users can create their
	own tags to fit their application needs.</p><div class="section"><a name="div-intro-elements"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="div-intro-elements"></a>Elements, Attributes, and Content</h3></div></div><p>The basic
	  construct in XML is called an
	  <span class="emphasis"><i>element</i></span>. For people familiar
	  with HTML, you might know this as a "tag".
	  For example, HTML has an &lt;img&gt; element for
	  putting graphics on a web page. Elements have a
	  name, zero or more attributes, and possibly some
	  content. In the raw text form of an XML document,
	  elements start with a beginning tag of the element
	  name enclosed within angle brackets (&lt; &gt;). XML
	  elements must have a closing tag of angle brackets
	  enclosing a slash and the element name. If the
	  element has no content, this slash can be inserted
	  at the end of the element's starting tag
	  immediately preceeding the trailing angle bracket.
	  An example of an element is given in 
	  <a href="ch01.html#example-intro-xml-elements-raw" title="Example 1.1. ">Example 1.1</a>
	</p><div class="example"><p><a name="example-intro-xml-elements-raw"></a><b>Example 1.1. </b></p><pre class="programlisting">
   &lt;elementname attribute="value"&gt;content&lt;/elementname&gt;
	  </pre></div><p>
	  <span class="emphasis"><i>Attributes</i></span> are named values
	  associated with an element. An example of an
	  attribute is shown above in <a href="ch01.html#example-intro-xml-elements-raw" title="Example 1.1. ">Example 1.1</a> The
	  <span class="emphasis"><i>content</i></span> of element can be other
	  elements, text, or both. When an element has both
	  text and other elements, it is known as "mixed
	  content". Text content is also known as
	  <span class="emphasis"><i>character data</i></span>,
	  PCDATA, or
	  CDATA.  </p><p>Xerlin
	  supports most of these constructs of XML except
	  CDATA. CDATA starts with <tt>&lt;![CDATA[</tt> and ends with
	  <tt>]]&gt;</tt>. CDATA items are not
	  currently supported as of Xerlin 1.2, but should be
	  supported in a future release.</p></div><div class="section"><a name="div-intro-dtd"></a><div class="titlepage"><div><h3 class="title"><a name="div-intro-dtd"></a>DTDs and Schemas</h3></div></div><p>XML uses something called
	  a Document Type Definition (DTD)
	  to determine what elements are valid for an XML
	  file, and what they can contain. A newer technology
	  called XML Schema has been introduced to replace
	  DTD's. However since this is such a new
	  technology (it hasn't been finalized as of this
	  writing), and the parser technologies Xerlin has
	  been built on top of don't support it, Xerlin
	  doesn't support Schemas in version 1.0.</p><p>To be able to add elements and create a valid
	  XML document, Xerlin requires a DTD in order to
	  work. There are many different DTDs available for
	  different applications, and there are books and
	  tutorials available on creating DTDs. Without a DTD,
	  Xerlin cannot present it's menu of what
	  elements can be added into the document. You can
	  view and edit documents which don't have a DTD,
	  but you will not be able to add anything new to
	  them.</p><p>The DTD is specified in an XML
	  document in a special element called the
	  <span class="emphasis"><i>DOCTYPE</i></span>. This document type
	  declaration includes the name of the root element,
	  an optional PUBLIC identifier, and a manditory
	  SYSTEM identifier. Xerlin handles the DOCTYPE
	  declaration and the identifiers behind the scenes
	  for you. A future version may give you more access
	  to edit these items directly.</p></div></div></div></body></html>
